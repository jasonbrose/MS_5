I am debating pivoting to the Coronavirus as more data comes out by country, so I am currently leveraging the gapminder dataset. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(infer)
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(purrr)
library(tibble)
library(stringr)
library(forcats)
library(ggthemes)
library(janitor)
library(knitr)
library(gapminder)


```


```{r, include = TRUE}


ms_5 <- gapminder%>%
  filter(continent == "Asia")


ggplot(ms_5, mapping = aes(year, gdpPercap))+
geom_point()+
facet_wrap(~country)
  

```
